                    The Balian treehouse is only a 3 minute walk away from the beach. From the veranda you can watch the sunrise in the morning, and enjoy the view of our beautiful garden (900m2) with pool.
                    <br> <br>
                        <b>The space</b><br>
                        We have several hangouts in our garden, and our pool is beautiful lit in the evening and turquoise in the daytime just inviting you to jump in. Upstairs is the open living area. The lazy couch on the veranda is overlooking the palm trees (TREEHOUSE) our beautiful garden and pool and has some ocean view aswell. It's the perfect place to wake up and relax drinking your coffee or tea. You can enjoy a nice ocean breeze when you feel its too warm to be outside in the sun or just when you feel the need to be nicely lazy..Inside there is a big (180 x 240) daybed with mosquito net if you need it. Downstairs there is the bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom and a second veranda. We have a rain shower with hot water, there is a standing fan and AC in the bedroom. In the bedroom there is a Flatscreen TV with some channels and movies on demand. The TV has a USB plug so you could take your favo movies or series to watch. We also have a dvd player. We use Indihome fiber for the quickest internet in Bali, so you can stream and download.
                        When arriving at his lovely and special village, you immediately feel all the good Bali has to offer you. Balian is a small surfer/relax village it feels like the older days in Bali.
                        We build the house as green as possible with a lot of decoration found in the nature, like the driftwood from the beach. I put a lot of blood, sweat, fun and tears in building this house. We are always busy expanding and updating the house which has to be done living near the ocean!!
                        The night market is nearby and has plenty of nice local food for great prices. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Guest access</b><br>
                        There is a small dirt road which will take you to the beach/village in only a few minutes. We decided not to built a concrete wall around our garden, there is no need for that in a security way and we don't like the feeling of being trapped (there are plenty of walls in the Seminyak area). 
                        There is still a lot of free land next to the house and it's a 2 min walk down to the beautiful river.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Other things to note</b><br>
                        We normally live in this house ourselves, so I think you can feel the difference from renting a hotel room because of that.
